I always think that photos are the best storytellers, so I list photos to help you and myself understand me.

In rainbows is my favorite album for Radiohead. Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi is always considerd the best love song for me! There is a live show for this album called ["In Rainbows From the Basement"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWuAn6C8Mfc).

Omnigenic model for eye color. Omnigenic model was first proposed by Prof.Jonathan K. Pritchard. I really love this paper! Simple but convincing analysis to proof the hypothesis. Hope I can do such great paper in the future!

This is from the graduation trip in Mount Siguniang with so many lovely friends I met at Nanjing University.
