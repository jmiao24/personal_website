title: "Photos about me"

I always think that photos are the best storytellers, so I list photos to help you and myself understand me.

### Ominigenic

Picuture illustrate the omnigenic model for eye color. [Omnigenic model](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30629-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417306293%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) was first proposed by Prof.Jonathan K. Pritchard. I really love this paper! Simple but convincing analysis to proof the hypothesis. Hope I can do such great paper in the future!

### Bayi Park in Nanchang

I took this photo in a park near my home when I was young. This photo comes from a series of photos I named "Bayi Park". It is about the daily life of people in the park. 

My favorite chinese photographer is [Grinch1982(Tao Liu )](https://grinch1982.com/liu-tao). His photo is about the dramatics and black humor in the atmosphere of the city.

### I Love Nanjing

"I Love Nanjing " is an album from [Zhi Li](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWTQhMAoQY8nc-WaIiVnssg) in 2009. I spend 3 years of my life in Nanjing. Nanjing changed me.  

As for Zhi Li, I attended his live concert two times, including the New Year's Eve concert â€œBelieve in Future" in 2018(may be the last public avaliable New Year's Eve concert for Zhi Li). He had a plan about holding live concert in 334 cities in China, but failed. :)

### In rainbows from Radiohead

In rainbows is my favorite album of Radiohead. Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi is always considerd the best love song for me! There is a live show for this album called ["In Rainbows From the Basement"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWuAn6C8Mfc). Hope you enjoy it!

I had my first oral talk at [IGSS2019](https://cupc.colorado.edu/conferences/IGSS_2019/) in CU Boulder! I met a lot of big names in the meeting. Some of them encouraged and praised me in person after my talk althought I thought my talk was imperfect. They are all nice people!

### AHSG2019 at Houston

I presented a poster at [ASHG20219](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/) in Houston. It is called genetics disney by my advisor. It is also fun but with different atomphere compared to IGSS. By the way, I became a Margarita lover in Houston. :)
