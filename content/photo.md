I took this photo in a park near my home when I was young. This photo comes from a series of photos I named "Bayi Park". It is about the daily life of people in the atmosphere of the park. My favorite chinese photographer is [Grinch1982(Tao Liu )](https://grinch1982.com/liu-tao). His photo is about the dramatic and black humor in the atmosphere of the city.
