I am a 1st year PhD student in Biomedical data science working with Prof. [Qiongshi Lu](http://qlu-lab.org/) at UW-Madison. My current research interests include statistical genetics especially robust inference on gene-environment interaction, social genomics and causal inference.

Prior to that, I graduated from [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) with a M.S in data science and [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) with a B.S. in statistics.

## Summer Projects
I've tried to keep busy!

**Swallowtail**: A light weight React UI to quickly and easily add a dark theme toggle to any website, while being highly customizable. [I wrote about building it here.](/blog/dark-like-my-soul)

**The Variance Blog**: I (finally) set up a blog for myself, after years of delaying it. I like to think my writing is unique, at the very least, and I talk about things I find very interesting.

**This Website!**: I finally ditched my old website that was made in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm still very proud of it, but I like this one much better.

**[WIP] Helena, The Command Line To-Do List**: Developing a command line to-do list that would be intuitive in receiving commands. Inspired by `ticktick's` recognition AI.

**[WIP] CodeStorm**: Developing a simple interface to rapidly drop updates at while programming, similar to Mark Zuckerburg's blog depicted in `The Social Network`.

## Reading
I'm trying to read more, but I often get bored and lose track. :( At the end of the summer, I'll add a list of all the books that I read.
