title: "About Me, Summer 2020 ðŸ’ª"
---

## Education
I'm currently pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley. This summer, I'm taking CS70: Discreet Math and Probability Theory from Berkeley.

## Teaching
I'm a big believer in the Feynmann Technique of learning â€“â€“ that the best teacher is the best learner. I'm a teaching assistant for CS61A at Berkeley this summer, and am extremely excited to help students through a class I thoroughly enjoyed. [Here's my course website that I set up for my students.](https://arushisomani.me/cs61a)

## Entrepreneurship
I'm currently working on [V A T T](https://vatt.caard.co), an SaaS product with the mission to dub and subtitle the internet. This summer, we're participating in Dorm Room Fund's Female Founder Track, working on rapidly iterate our product, ready for release and fundraising.

## Internship
I'm interning this summer as a software development engineer at [Vurbl Media](https://vurbl.com), a startup developing a Youtube-like platform for podcasts. I'm part of the development team working on a transcription and tagging algorithm.

## BEGIN Volunteer
I'm working as a Web Developer and Marketing Specialist for Berkeley SCET's Gateway To Innovation Program. This summer, I'm working on developing a new landing page and improving user experience.

## STEP Developer
I'm working as a developer for Berkeley's Student Entrepreneurship Program. I'll be reforming the website, updating backend and developing software for use of participating teams to track KPIs. 

## Music
I love Bollywood music, and acoustic guitars. While I'm no expert, I try to get some practise in every night! I'm too shy to release anything right now, but hopefully I'll get enough courage to receive courage eventually.

## Summer Projects
I've tried to keep busy!

**Swallowtail**: A light weight React UI to quickly and easily add a dark theme toggle to any website, while being highly customizable. [I wrote about building it here.](/blog/dark-like-my-soul)

**The Variance Blog**: I (finally) set up a blog for myself, after years of delaying it. I like to think my writing is unique, at the very least, and I talk about things I find very interesting.

**This Website!**: I finally ditched my old website that was made in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm still very proud of it, but I like this one much better.

**[WIP] Helena, The Command Line To-Do List**: Developing a command line to-do list that would be intuitive in receiving commands. Inspired by `ticktick's` recognition AI.

**[WIP] CodeStorm**: Developing a simple interface to rapidly drop updates at while programming, similar to Mark Zuckerburg's blog depicted in `The Social Network`.

## Reading
I'm trying to read more, but I often get bored and lose track. :( At the end of the summer, I'll add a list of all the books that I read.
